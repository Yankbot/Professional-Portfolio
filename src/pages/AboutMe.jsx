          Outside of work, I enjoy playing soccer, weightlifting, and diving into personal research and projects that expand my technical skillset. I currently hold an A.A.S. in Cybersecurity and the Splunk Core Certified User certification. I'm also actively preparing for the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701), which I plan to complete in June 2025.

          I'm seeking an internship or full-time position that provides mentorship, challenges me technically, and allows me to grow in the field of Red Teaming and cybersecurity operations.
